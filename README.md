<h1>GraphingFourier</h1>
Python Code that allows you to  graph the iterations of <b>Fourier Series</b>.


To use this code, the main python script is "LINEALES - FourierSeries.py", run it and follow each step indicated as a prompt. 

Always use "x" to indicate independent variable.

To indicate powers you can use conventional notations like "x^2".

To indicate Ï€, you should use "pi".

To indicate factors like 2x^2, you should iput 2*x^2.

The result is an iterative ouput of graphs, like this:

The rest of files are modules used by the main script. And "Graphing_Fourier.py" is an experimentation still in development.
